    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        <i>Krieg Eterna</i> is a game of strategizing and bluffing your way to victory across a series of
        battles against your opponent. Command your army in the field to attack with precision,
        deceive enemy officers, and overrun opposing regiments!
    </p>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        A game of Krieg Eterna is divided into <span class="rule-word">three separate rounds</span> of play, where your ultimate
        objective is to win more rounds than your opponent. Players take turns playing units and
        powers to build the strength of their army. At the end of each round, the player with the
        most strength across all of their rows wins that round.

    </picture>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        At the <span class="rule-word">start of the game</span>, each player draws <span class="rule-word">9 unit</span> cards, <span class="rule-word">4 power</span> cards, and <span class="rule-word">1 King</span> card.
        After review, players <span class="rule-word">must discard 3</span> of their cards (any type) before play begins. Unless a
        card says otherwise, these are the only cards drawn for the entire game. Players then take
        turns playing one card at a time until all players have said <span class="rule-word">"pass"</span>, after which they score
        the field, discard all cards on the field to the <span class="rule-word">graveyards</span> (face up), and start the next
        round.
    </p>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Playing Field</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        Next is a diagram showing the layout of the <span class="rule-word">playing field</span>. Each player's side of
        the field is split into three rows: <span class="rule-word">Melee</span>, <span class="rule-word">Range</span>, and <span class="rule-word">Siege</span>. There is no limit to the number
        of cards played in rows, and unit cards may be rearranged within a row at any time.

        <h3>Cards</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        There are <span class="rule-word">three separate decks</span> of cards shared between all players: the <span class="rule-word">unit</span> deck, <span class="rule-word">power</span> deck, and <span class="rule-word">King</span> deck -- each with a different colored card-backing. Each deck also has its
        own <span class="rule-word">graveyard</span>, in which discarded cards are placed face up. Within each deck there are
        different <span class="rule-word">card types</span>, indicated by the symbol in the upper-right corner of a card.

        <h3>Units</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        The <span class="rule-word">unit deck</span> consists of Melee, Ranged, and Siege cards. All unit cards have a <span class="rule-word">base
        strength</span> number in the upper-right corner, indicating how many points they will score at the
        end of a round. The total strength of a unit can be increased or decreased beyond the base
        strength using the effects of other cards.

    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Powers</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        The <span class="rule-word">power deck</span> consists of Weather, Spy, Jester, and Hex cards, each with a <span class="rule-word">card effect</span>
        granting unique abilities. Unless otherwise indicated, these cards are played to the side
        (not in the Melee, Range, or Siege rows) and immediately go to the graveyard after use.

    {{< icon-paragraph icon="Weather" text="Weather cards affect the total strength of one of the rows, for all players.

Keep Weather cards on the field until their effects end." >}}

    {{< icon-paragraph icon="Spy" text="Spy cards allow you to draw cards, but are played as units on your opponent's side of the field, thereby adding to your opponent's total strength. At the end of the round, most Spys go directly to the hand of the player whose side of the field they are on, allowing your opponent to turn your Spys against you." >}}
    {{< icon-paragraph icon="Jester" text="Jester cards can return cards on the field back to your hand, or set them aside for the next round. Use them to deceive your opponent." >}}
    {{< icon-paragraph icon="Hex" text="Hex cards allow for drawing cards, sending cards to the graveyard, or other useful effects. Hex cards attached to a specific unit follow with that unit, e.g. to the graveyard, another row, or even a player's hand." >}}
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Kings</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        The <span class="rule-word">King deck</span> contains all King cards, and each player should choose one at random at the
        start of the game. Each player's King card can only be scored in one round per game (i.e. it
        does not return to your hand each round). King cards are <span class="rule-word">not affected</span> by other cards, unless
        specifically mentioned.
    </p>
    {{< cardflip front="LionKing" back="FlagKing" disallowScale="mobile" >}}
    {{< icon-paragraph icon="King" text="King cards allow you to double the strength of one of your rows, as well as having a choice between other unique effects. A King only doubles the row while it remains on the field." >}}
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Adjacency</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        If two units with the same strength are in the same row, they get an <span class="rule-word">adjacency bonus</span> which
        doubles the strength of both units. Adjacency bonuses only apply to units with <span class="rule-word">two or three
        strength</span>. You cannot add a third unit to this adjacent pair, but you can have multiple pairs
        on the field. Note that adjacency effects can be enabled or broken by power cards that
        modify a unit's strength.
    </p>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        <span class="rule-word"><u>Example 1</u>:</span> A row has 3 units with base strength 2. Two units form an adjacent pair, but the
        third does not get a bonus. The row's total score is: (2 × 2) + (2 × 2) + 2 = 10.
    </p>
    <img src="/gif/AdjacencyEx1.gif" alt="" class="landscape-gif" unselectable="on" loading="lazy">
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        <span class="rule-word"><u>Example 2</u>:</span> A row has 2 units with base strength 4. A certain power is then played to
        subtract 1 strength from all units in that row. Both units now have strength 3, and so
        receive an adjacency bonus. The row's total score is: ((4 - 1) × 2) + ((4 - 1) × 2) = 12.
    </p>
    <img src="/gif/AdjacencyEx2.gif" alt="" class="landscape-gif" unselectable="on" loading="lazy">
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Passing</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        Before playing any cards on your turn, you may say <span class="rule-word">"pass"</span> to signal you are ready to end
        the round. Once a player has passed, they may not play any more cards until the next round.
        Other players may continue to play cards, taking as many turns as desired before eventually
        passing themselves. After all players have passed, the round is scored.
    </p>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Scoring The Round</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        Each of your units on the field contributes its <span class="rule-word">total strength</span> to your score for the round
        as follows:
    </p>
        <ol class="rule-paragraph">
            <li class="li-pad">Start with each unit's <span class="rule-word">base strength</span> number found in the upper-right corners of the cards.</li>
            <li class="li-pad">Apply all modifiers with keywords: <span class="rule-word">set</span> base strength.</li>
            <li class="li-pad">Apply all modifiers with keywords: <span class="rule-word">add</span> or <span class="rule-word">subtract</span> base strength.</li>
            <li class="li-pad">If there are <span class="rule-word">adjacency bonuses</span> at this point, double the strength of units forming adjacent pairs.</li>
            <li class="li-pad">Apply all row multipliers (keywords: <span class="rule-word">double</span> or <span class="rule-word">halve</span> strength) from <span class="rule-word">weather effects</span> and <span class="rule-word">King bonuses</span> to each unit. Always round down if dividing, with a <span class="rule-word">minimum strength</span> of one per unit.</li>
        </ol>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Winning</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        After adding all units' total strengths together, the player with the <span class="rule-word">highest number wins</span>
        the round (the size of the victory does not matter).
    </p>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        The first player to <span class="rule-word">win two rounds</span> wins the game. If no player has won two rounds and no
        player can play any cards, the game is a draw.
    </p>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Final Details</h3>
    </div>
    <ul class="rule-paragraph">
        <li class="li-pad"><span class="rule-word">Going first:</span> In the first round, the player who dealt the unit deck (or won the last game)
        goes first. In later rounds, the previous round's winner goes first.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">If a card says to draw, you may pick any combination of unit or power cards, unless
        otherwise specified. King cards are never drawn after the initial setup.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">If an opponent asks, you must tell them the number of unit and power cards you have in your
        hand.</li>
        <li class="li-pad"><span class="rule-word">Set aside cards</span> do not score for the current round and cannot be affected by other cards
        this round. At the start of the next round, return them directly to the field, in their same
        row (do this before the first turn is taken). Do not repeat any card effects.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">If a power card has an <span class="rule-word">activation cost</span> (e.g. "send a unit to the graveyard"), you must pay
        its price in order to play the card at all. This prevents players from stalling with
        unusable/undesired power cards.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">Players may <span class="rule-word">never skip</span> their turn. They must always either play a card, or "pass" the rest of the round.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="title-wrapper rule-title">
        <h3>Additional Players</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="rule-paragraph">
        When playing <i>Krieg Eterna</i> with more than two players, you can choose to either play in teams
        or a free-for-all:
    </p>
    <ul class="rule-paragraph">
        <li class="li-pad">Players should not show their hands to teammates.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">Each player has their own separate set of rows (e.g. teammates do not share rows, adjacency, or Kings).</li>
        <li class="li-pad">Turn order should alternate between teams.</li>
        <li class="li-pad">Teammates can never play on your turn for you, even if you have already passed.</li>
        <li class="li-pad"><span class="rule-word">Scoring:</span> In free-for-all, award points based on a player's ranking within each round. In a
        team game, the team with the highest combined total strength wins the round.</li>
