<p>
<i>The Holy Grail</i> in Lord Tennyson's <i>Idylls of the King</i> discusses the quests of Percival, Galahad, and other knights of the Round Table in searching for the Holy Grail that would ultimately lead to the destruction of King Arthur's court at Camelot. Galahad sees the grail in a vision and all of the knights vow to quest for it, but many do not return and the Grail is lost forever. The question might be, is it noble to throw ourselves at unattainable goals? Some of the knights did see the grail by the end of their quest, but was their success worth the dissolution of Camelot?
