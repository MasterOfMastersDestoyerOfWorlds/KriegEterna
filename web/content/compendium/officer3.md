Thomas Paine is perhaps the most important writer of the American Revolution, in his pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i> he convinced the American Colonists to go to war for their independence and in his later work, <i>The Crisis</i>, inspired the army's resolve.

"The heart that feels not now is dead; the blood of his children will curse his cowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole, and made them happy. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death."
