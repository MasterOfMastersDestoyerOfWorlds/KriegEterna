Composed by William Boyce, the song <i>Hearts of Oak</i> served as the Royal Navy's official march until the modern day. In his time Boyce was respected by Mozart and Bach, but ultimately forgotten after his death. This should supply ample warning to those of us wishing for fame beyond the grave, even the greatest of us will be forgotten with enough time.
