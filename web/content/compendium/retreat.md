The retreat from the Battle of Laon signified the beginning of the end for Napoleon's first reign. Often outnumbered by Coalition forces in France, as much of his forces were tied down in French-Occupied Iberia fighting Spanish rebels (see also {{<cardlink name="Assault" code="assault2">}}), Napoleon realized he either had to make peace or rally troops throughout the French country side. Napoleon decided on the latter, but while he was moving his army south Paris fell to the Coalition army. The French Senate soon deposed him as Emperor and Napoleon's generals would not take back Paris fearing the destruction of the city.

Napoleon, realizing that he had no other option, signed the abdication order with his familiar flair:
</p>
<p>
"Emperor Napoleon, faithful to his oath, declares that he renounces, for himself and his heirs the throne of France and Italy; and that there is no personal sacrifice, not even that of life itself, which he is not willing to make for the interests of France."
</p>
<p>
With his army disbanded, the French monarchy restored, and Napoleon himself exiled to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean, it would take a miracle for Ex-Emperor to make a comeback (see also {{<cardlink name="Grenadier">}}).
