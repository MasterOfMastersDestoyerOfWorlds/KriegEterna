The flavor text was inspired by Ted Chiang's <i>Tower of Babylon</i> short story in which the biblical Tower of Babel has been constructed over eons of labor and pilgrims will spend their entire lives to carry one brick up the tower. If you get a chance read his anthology <i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i>, it is filled with thought provoking fiction and is generally accessible. His story <i>Seventy-Two Letters</i> where scientists can make machines from clay golems is particularly fascinating, and in general, Chiang is excellent at weaving and extending the myths of our world into new and interesting stories.
