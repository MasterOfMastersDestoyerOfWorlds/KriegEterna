<p class="rule-paragraph">
Sir Francis Walsingham was a prominent English statesman and spymaster during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He served as her principal secretary from 1573 to 1590 and was instrumental in foiling several plots against her, including the Throckmorton Plot and the Babington Plot. These plots were attempts by Catholic Spain to replace the Protestant Queen Elizabeth with her Catholic half sister Mary Queen of Scotts through a planned invasion of England. After the plot was discovered Walsingham pushed the Elizabeth to execute Mary. Mary was beheaded in the following months, apparently against the wishes of the Queen. After the execution, Walsingham used his spy network to discover the details of the planned Spanish Invasion (see also  {{<cardlink name="Armada" code="armada2">}}).
