<p>
Sir Francis Walsingham was a prominent English statesman and spymaster during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He served as her principal secretary from 1573 to 1590 and was instrumental in foiling several plots against her, including the Throckmorton Plot and the Babington Plot. These plots were attempts by Catholic Spain to replace the Protestant Queen Elizabeth with her Catholic half sister Mary Queen of Scots through a planned invasion of England. Walsingham had seen the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of the Huguenots (pictured below) as a younger man and this greatly shaped his view of Catholics as extremely violent and untrustworthy (see also {{<cardlink name="Sun King" code="sun-king">}} or {{<cardlink name="Traitor King" code="traitor-king">}}). He would do everything in his power, including spying on and torturing suspected Catholic priests, in order to avoid similar religious strife in England.

After the plot was discovered, Walsingham pushed Elizabeth to execute Mary. Mary during her trial famously said: "All of this is the work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction." Mary was beheaded in the following months, apparently against the wishes of the Queen. After the execution, Walsingham used his spy network to discover the details of the planned Spanish Invasion (see also  {{<cardlink name="Armada" code="armada2">}}).
