<p>
The Landsknechts were a loose group of German mercenaries that carried pikes and halberdiers in the early modern period that fought in large pike square formations (see also {{<cardlink name="Square">}}). At the front of the formation stood the Doppels√∂ldner or "double pay men" who would wield large swords and had the highest casualty rates. The Landsknechts were initially an elite group trained for the Holy Roman Emperor's army, but they soon sold their talents all over Europe. As the centuries went on developments in gunpowder technology, combined arms tactics, and the rise of professional armies decreased the reliance of states on mercenary companies spelling an end for the Landsknechts.
