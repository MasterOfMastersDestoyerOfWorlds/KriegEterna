<p class="rule-paragraph">
Gustavus Adolphus was the first in a line of Swedish kings that led the country to its zenith by the early 1700's. When Gustavus inherited the throne, Sweden was embroiled in three separate wars and the King of Poland, Sigismund III, was looking to enforce his dynastic claims on the Throne of Sweden. Gustavus resolved these conflicts, reformed the Swedish army, and went on to take Livonia and Pomerania on the Baltic Sea for Sweden. His intervention in the Thirty Years War raised Sweden's status from a European backwater to the center of a northern Protestant alliance that took on the Holy Roman Emperor and largely succeeded while Gustavus remained alive (see also {{<cardlink name="Demise">}}).
