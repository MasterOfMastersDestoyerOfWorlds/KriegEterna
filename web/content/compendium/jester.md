<i>The Cask of Amontillado</i> is one of Edgar Allen Poe's most riveting and disturbing tales. The story follows two men during the Carnival of Venice. One of the men and our narrator, Montresor, plans to murder his acquaintance and rival, Fortunato, after some unknown slight. In order to lure Fortunato away from the festivities, Montresor promises him a cask of Amontillado wine if only he will come with him to the cellar to retrieve it. Plying him with wine along the way, Montresor then chains up Fortunato to a wall at the end of the catacombs where he has said the wine is. Over the course of the night, Montresor slowly seals Fortunato into a false wall that he constructs in front of him, leaving him to die in the darkness.

"Ha! ha! ha! --he! he! he! --a very good joke, indeed --an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he! he! he! --over our wine --he! he! he!"
