<p>
Ivan IV The Terrible was the first Tsar of Russia and his reign would serve as the model for Russian rulers until the present day. All of the elements are there: greatly increasing the size of the army, the formation of the first Russian secret police, and a series of costly wars to expand toward the Baltic, the Caspian and the Black seas. These goals and methods would rise time and time again in Russia from the rule of Peter to Catherine to Stalin.

<p>
During his reign Ivan would conquer the Kazan and Astrakhan Khanates (present day southern Russia) increasing the territory of Russia by roughly a third. However, his costly attempts to conquer Livonia (present day Estonia and Latvia) in order to gain a port on the Baltic would prove costly and unsuccessful. His rule was that of the autocrat, where personal allegiance and friendship to the Tsar was much more important than any other political or economic power (see also {{<cardlink name="Wrath">}}).
