<p>
Austerlitz or "The Battle of the Three Emperors" is considered by many to be Napoleon's masterstroke putting him in the same league as Hannibal or Caesar and is featured prominently in Leo Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>. For days before the battle, Napoleon feigned weakness by calling for an armistice and retreating from the Austerlitz heights. When the Austrian and Russian forces found out that they outnumbered the French army they went on the offensive. Unknown to the Allies, this was part of Napoleon's plan and his army was similar in size to the Allies.

The French armies in the area that seemed to be retreating hurried back to the battlefield completing the ensnarement. At one point even the weather conspired in Napoleon's favor, when a thick {{<cardlink name="fog">}} concealed the French infantry from the Russian artillery until the French were almost on top of them. By the end of the battle, 30 thousand of the Allied army and nine thousand of the French army laid dead. After Napoleon's victory, the Allies sued for peace. Emperor Francis of Austria would dissolve the Holy Roman Empire the next year as it had failed in its purpose to protect Germany and the Austrians wanted to prevent Napoleon from proclaiming himself Holy Roman Emperor (see also {{<cardlink name="Retreat">}}).
