The flavor text is from Leo Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i> espoused by Prince Andrei Bolkonsky after his return from the battle of Austerlitz (see also {{<cardlink name="Feint">}}). Andrei had taken his life and wife for granted and had abandoned her in her pregnancy to seek glory in the Napoleonic Wars. This quotation signifies the beginning of his transformation from a selfish and cynical man into a humble and hopeful one. After Andrei is injured in the Battle of Borodino, he gains a new outlook on life and learns to forgive those who've wronged him.

The text mirrors Luke 9:60 when Christ tells his disciple who wants to spend a year mourning the body of his father: "Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and preach the kingdom of God." Implying that people who worry about such things, instead of using their time here on Earth well, are already dead (see also {{<cardlink name="Cavalry" code="cavalry3">}}).
