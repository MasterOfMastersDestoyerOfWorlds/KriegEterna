<p>
In the Netherlands' Eighty Years War with Spain, the port of Dunkirk remained in Spanish hands for the majority of the war. The Dunkirkers became a major enemy to the Dutch as they would capture the merchantman ships that were keeping the Dutch economy afloat in the face of a hegemonic but continually bankrupt Spanish Crown. From this golden age of Dutch piracy and trade came the myth of the Flying Dutchman, a crew of ghostly sailors that would appear asking after men long dead.

Accodring to John Leyden's <i>Scenes of Infancy</i> "The crew of this vessel are supposed to have been guilty of some dreadful crime, in the infancy of navigation; and to have been stricken with pestilence ... and are ordained still to traverse the ocean on which they perished, till the period of their penance expire"
