{{<card-detail-page title="Void" artwork="Portrait of Fedor Dostoyevsky by Vasily Perov (1872)">}}
<p>
From Dostoyevsky's <i>The Idiot</i> in which his character undergoes a mock execution, but the order is recalled at the last second before he was shot (see also {{<cardlink name="Offering">}} or {{<cardlink name="Wrath">}}). This actually happened to Dostoyevsky, he and the group of writers that he was working with were sentenced to death by the Tsar for the socialist nature of their works and distributing socialist literature, at the last second before the firing squad fired and officer rode up with a stay of execution from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky would spend the next four years in prison in Siberia.

This story is somewhat evocative of the film <i>The Ascent</i> (1977) in which two Russian prisoners of war in German occupied Belarus are scentenced to death and must decide whether to betray their countrymen.
