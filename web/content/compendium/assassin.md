<p>
After defying the senate and crossing into Italy with the full force of his army (see also {{<cardlink name="Fate">}}), Julius Caesar would change Rome forever. Defeating the opposition armies and proclaiming himself Emperor in a protracted civil war, Caesar would find himself with unlimited power and would use it to make social reforms making him extremely popular with the general public.

Just one year later, Caesar would be dead on the Senate floor having been stabbed 23 times. The most famous of his assassins was Marcus Brutus who was initially on the side of Pompey during the civil war. After Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus in which 30,000 of his men were killed, Brutus switched sides to follow Caesar and led many other prominent Romans to do the same. For this reason Brutus has been seen as both betrayer, for orchestrating the assassination of his friend and savior, and enlightened republican, for killing the tyrant and destroyer of democracy. In Dante's Inferno Brutus was said to be in the mouth of Satan along with Judas, the disciple who sold Jesus to his enemies before his crucifixion, and Cassius, another conspirator against Caesar (see also {{<cardlink name="Styx">}}). Rome itself would never again return to republicanism as Brutus and Cassius were defeated in the ensuing civil war after the death of Caesar (see also {{<cardlink name="Sack">}}).
