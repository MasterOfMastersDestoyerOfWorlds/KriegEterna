<p>
The painting contains a double meaning about the nature of war and the heads of state that cause it. Painted at near the end of the thirty years war, one of the most brutal and protracted conflicts in the history of Europe, the painting depicts the story of the Feast of Herod from the Bible. In the story, Herod is the King of Galilee and at his birthday banquet his daughter, Salome, performs a dance so beautiful that Herod promises her anything within his power to grant. Salome asks her mother what she should ask the king for and her mother, Herodias, replies that she wants the head of John the Baptist who had previously condemned her incestuous marriage. King Herod complies and serves John's head on a silver platter to Salome.

This scene has been depicted fairly literally in many paintings, plays and even movies, but in this painting the feast takes on a new meaning. The Czech artist Bartlomiej Strobel had either painted portraits of or found existing portraits of all of the heads of state (Kings, Queens, Princes, etc.) that had been involved in the Thirty Years War. This implies that they had destroyed Europe for the same reasons that Herodias had asked for John the Baptist's head, their own self aggrandizement and greed.
