{{<card-detail-page code="Burden" artwork="Atlas holding up the celestial globe by Guercino (1646)" attr="Giles Corey">}}
<p>
This painting depicts the Titan Atlas of Greek mythology, condemned by Zeus to hold the heavens on his shoulders for all eternity because of his part in leading the Titans against the gods of Olympus.  Atlas was considered to be the father of many constellations, the founder of astronomy, and his name was given to the Atlantic ocean.

The painting was one of a pair commissioned by Lorenzo deâ€™ Medici as a posthumous tribute to Galileo Galilei (see also  {{<cardlink name="Telescope">}}).

Words uttered by Giles Corey in 1692 as he was being pressed to death with stones after refusing to stand trial for witchcraft.  Caught up in the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Corey is the only person in the United States to be pressed to death, a sentence which was illegal even at the time (see also  {{<cardlink name="Execution">}}).
