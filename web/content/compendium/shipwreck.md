<p>
Men and women clamour ashore having narrowly escaped their watery grave. This painitng is reminiceint of the Flying Dutchmen (see also  {{<cardlink name="Privateer" code="privateer">}}) or the fabled Swedish ship, the Vasa, that sunk during it maiden voyage from Ã„lvsnabben south of Stockholm. Gustavus Adolphus (see also  {{<cardlink name="Lion King" code="lion-king">}}) had ordered the flag ship to have an extra deck of guns after the basic design had already been laid out and contruction had begun. This shifted the center of gravity upward, such that when a gust of wind came, it toppled the ship over. However, given that Vernet spent most of his life around the Mediterranean, that is likely the subject of the painting rather than the Baltic.
