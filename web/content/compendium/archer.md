<p>
Hendrick Joseph Dillens was a Belgian painter in the early 19th century.  This oil painting, Archer the Winner is a genre painting, intended to show scenes of everyday life.  In this moment, the archer has won his competition and is being celebrated by the townspeople.  The archer is the only figure looking out of the painting directly at the viewer, as if to let us know that we are included in the celebration.
