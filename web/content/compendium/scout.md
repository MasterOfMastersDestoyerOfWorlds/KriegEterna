The British had invaded Afghanistan in 1838, hoping to install a friendly ruler and counter the influence of Russia in the region. However, they soon faced resistance from the Afghan people, who resented the foreign occupation and the unpopular puppet king, Shah Shuja.

The British commander, Major-General William Elphinstone, decided to negotiate a safe passage for his troops and civilians to Jalalabad. All along the mountain passes back to India the British were constantly ambushed by Afghani tribesmen. Only one European, William Brydon, and a few Indian sepoys reached Jalalabad alive. The rest were either killed, captured, or died of exposure.
