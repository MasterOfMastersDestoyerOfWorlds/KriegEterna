Reliquaries were gold, silver, and ivory boxes housed in cathedrals and churches all over Europe. Inside were the body parts of dead saints, kings and biblical figures. However, the provenance of the saint's relics could sometimes be suspect. For example, John the Baptist had at least four different heads, two right arms, and 24 fingers if every claim is to be believed.
