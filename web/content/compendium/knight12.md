<p>
Such, Britons! is the cause, to you unknown,
<br>
<br>
Or worse, o’erlook’d; o’erlook’d by magistrates,
<br>
<br>
Thus criminals themselves. I grant the deed
<br>
<br>
Is madness, but the madness of the heart.
<br>
<br>
And what is that? Our utmost bound of guilt.
<br>
<br>
A sensual, unreflecting life, is big
<br>
<br>
With monstrous births, and suicide, to crown
<br>
<br>
The black infernal brood. The bold to break
<br>
<br>
Heaven’s law supreme, and desperately rush,
<br>
<br>
Through sacred Nature’s murder, on their own,
<br>
<br>
Because they never think of death, they die.

<p>
’Tis equally man’s duty, glory, gain,
<br>
<br>
At once to shun, and meditate, his end.
<br>
<br>
When by the bed of languishment we sit
<br>
<br>
(The seat of wisdom! if our choice, not fate),
<br>
<br>
Or, o’er our dying friends, in anguish hang,
<br>
<br>
Wipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,
<br>
<br>
Number their moments, and, in every clock,
<br>
<br>
Start at the voice of an eternity;
<br>
<br>
See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift
<br>
<br>
An agonizing beam, at us to gaze,
<br>
<br>
Then sink again, and quiver into death,
<br>
<br>
That most pathetic herald of our own;
<br>
<br>
How read we such sad scenes? As sent to man
<br>
<br>
In perfect vengeance? No; in pity sent,
<br>
<br>
To melt him down, like wax, and then impress,
<br>
<br>
Indelible, Death’s image on his heart;
<br>
<br>
Bleeding for others, trembling for himself.
<br>
<br>
We bleed, we tremble, we forget, we smile.
<br>
<br>
The mind turns fool, before the cheek is dry.
<br>
<br>
Our quick-returning folly cancels all;
<br>
<br>
As the tide rushing razes what is writ
<br>
<br>
In yielding sands, and smooths the letter’d shore.
<br>
