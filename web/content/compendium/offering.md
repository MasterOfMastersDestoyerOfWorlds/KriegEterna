This card's flavor text is from the end of the novel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> by Fyodor Dostoevsky (see also {{<cardlink name="Void">}} or {{<cardlink name="Wrath">}}). By the end of the novel our protagonist, Rakolnikov, has confessed to his crime of murder and is serving out his punishment in Siberia. This mirror's Dostoyevksy's real life in which he was sent to Siberia by the Tzar for his subversive writing. During his stay he was only allowed to read the Bible and according to Dostoyevksy the conditons were as such: "In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold. All the floors were rotten. We were packed like herrings in a barrel ... There was no room to turn around."

The card's painting is titled the "Lamb of God" an allusion to Christ's death and sacrifice in order to save the world from sin. The irony in the painting is that the lamb has been hogtied and therefore is not sacrificing itself but is being sacrificed.
