<p>
Joan of Arc was a peasant girl who, after having visions of French success in the Hundred Years War against the English, was sent by the French King Charles VII to support the army (see also {{<cardlink name="Knight" code="knight9">}}). Her appearance at some of the largest French victories of the war won her fame, adoration, and even a role in the military as a leader at a time when this was unheard of for women. After a few failed sieges which stained her reputation at court, she organized the relief of Compiègne but was captured by her Burgundian and English enemies in the process.

Once captured, she was put on trial as a heretic. Her visions were painted as the whispering of the devil, her dress in full armour and other male clothing was deemed sacrilege, and her insistence that only God could judge her actions rather than the church was seen as heresy. The English, wishing to paint Charles VII as a supporter of a heretic, fixed the trial and burnt Joan at the stake after she refused to renounce her visions.
