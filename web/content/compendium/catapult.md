<p class="rule-paragraph">
Roman soldiers operate a siege engine during their attack on the walls of Carthage in 146 BCE(the third Punic War). The words on the catapult read “Delenda est Carthago (Carthage must be Destroyed)”, attributed to  Cato the Elder, a Roman senator and historian.  The siege ended in the destruction of Carthage.

<p class="rule-paragraph">
The flavor text is from Polybius' Histories, which cover the period of 264 BC to 146 BC and are primarily concerned with the 53 years in which Ancient Rome became a dominant world power.
