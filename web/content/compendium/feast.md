This card is in reference to an event in the 13th century where the young earl of Douglas and his brother were invited to dine with the King of Scotland James II. At the start of the dinner a black bull's head was placed in front of William Douglas signifying his death. He and his Brother were then given a show trial and beheaded despite the young King's protest. William's great uncle James Douglas would inherit his title and is likely the main conspirator.
