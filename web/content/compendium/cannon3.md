{{<card-detail-page code="Cannon3" artwork="On the ramparts by Jehan Georges Vibert (1867)" >}}
<p>
Jehan Vibert was a French academic painter who served in the Franco-Prussian war, and whose art was collected by many wealthy Americans.  The realism of On the Ramparts is typical of his work.  Clearly the soldiers in the painting are more interested in entertaining their visitors than in attending to their posts, and this irony is also seen in Vibertâ€™s later works of Catholic cardinals.
