It is no great coincidence  that the first civilization arose from walled cities. From the times of Sargon and Gilgamesh, we have used walls to keep the terrors of war and robbery on the outside and learning and wealth on the inside. A ruler that could accomplish this could project power much farther than the confines of the city in which they held principal domain, and therefore could establish empire, safe in the knowledge that the cities they left behind while warring could be easily secured.

By the time of the Viking age castles were routinely built in order to fend off raiders and secure towns. When the French Normans invaded England and took the crown in 1066, the started to build castles in the French tradition in order to quell rebellion and display the magnitude of their power. It was often important who built them, as a castle owned by a nobel in a decentralized state with a weak king, could be used as a base for rebellion.

With the advent of gunpowder cannons, fortifications also evolved becoming large earthworks with thick angled stone walls to deflect cannonballs. In the arms race between ballistics and thick walls,  ballistics won, and today armies are much more likely to rely on anti-aircraft guns and pre-positioned troops rather than the protection of stone and dirt. Bunkers need to be miles deep or very well hidden to protect against the most effective missiles.
