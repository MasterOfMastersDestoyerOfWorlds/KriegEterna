    This card depicts the 1618 Defenestration of Prague, in which three Catholic nobles were thrown out of a window at Prague Castle after a dispute over the right to build Protestant churches. All three survived the fall, but as the situation devolved into open revolt, the Emperor and the Bohemians prepared for war (see also {{<cardlink name="Winter King" code="winter-king">}}).

<p>
     The circumstances were eerily similar to the 1419 Defenestration in which a mob of Hussites (a Bohemian religious movement which predated the Protestant Reformation but shared in many of its beliefs) threw Catholic local officials out of a window in the town hall. This previous defenestration led to the Hussite wars with the Emperor.
