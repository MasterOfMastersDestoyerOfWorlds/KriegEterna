{{<card-detail-page title="Armada2" artwork="Spanish Armada by Philip James de Loutherbourg (1796)">}}
<p>
Philip James de Loutherbourg was a French-born British painter known for large naval works and elaborate set designs. 
</p>
<p>
In this painting he depicts the Battle of Gravelines in which the Spanish Armada – which had been sent by Phillip II of Spain to invade England – was defeated.  The English fleet, although smaller, consisted of ships that were more maneuverable and could carry more guns.  With the faster ships and some help from the weather, the English broke up the Spanish Armada.  Of 150 Spanish ships, only 65 would return to Spain (see also  {{<cardlink name="Spy" code="spy">}}).
