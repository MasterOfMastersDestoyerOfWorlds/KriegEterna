<p>
This card is in reference to the surrender of Vercingetorix to Caesar and its consequences. After the Battle of Alesia where Caesar decisively took Gaul for the Romans, it was only a few short years until Caesar would decide to cross the Rubicon river in northern Italy in order to march on Rome and ultimately end the Republic becoming the First Emperor of Rome. The often repeated phrase "the die is cast" is called into question here. If we are to believe Caesar, as soon as he crossed the Rubicon and entered Italy with his army there was no turning back till he was Emperor. But maybe the events were set in motion by his earlier conquests in Gaul or he could have still preserved the republic through other means (see also {{<cardlink name="Assassin">}}).
