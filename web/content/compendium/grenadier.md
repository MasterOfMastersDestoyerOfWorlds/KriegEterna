The flavor text is attributed to General Cambronne, one of Napoleon's generals, during the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Cambronne replied with this quote when asked to surrender by the Duke of Wellington after the battle had clearly been lost.

Napoleon had escaped from his first exile in Elba and returned to take the French throne sparking the war of the seventh coalition (see also {{<cardlink name="Retreat">}}). On Napoleon's march from the Mediterranean to Paris, the ruling French government sent regiments to stop his advance, but the soldiers seeing their old Emperor would defect to his side shouting "Vive L'Empereur!"(see also {{<cardlink name="Cavalry" code="cavalry2">}}). The Battle of Waterloo would mark the final defeat of Napoleon and his grand army, after trouncing Europe for nearly 20 years, he was old and losing support in France and abdicated as Emperor four days later. The man who once held  dominion from Spain to Russia was sent to the ends of the earth to die in obscurity.
