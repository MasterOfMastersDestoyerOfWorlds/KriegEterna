"The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time." 
</br>
</br>
This was said by American author and poet Jack London. London was most famous for his stories about the Klondike and his story "To Build a Fire" is perhaps the best of his short stories. The story involves a man who sets out for a hike in the Canadian Yukon region, where temperatures are often some of the coldest in the world, and records his slow and predictable death after a few small, but not life threatening, mistakes snowball into him freezeing to death having failed to get warm and build a fire. An excerpt from the story describes the man's hubris perfectly:
</br>
</br>
"The trouble with him was that he was not able to imagine. He 
was quick and ready in the things of life, but only in the things, and not 
in their meanings. Fifty degrees below zero meant 80 degrees of frost. 
Such facts told him that it was cold and uncomfortable, and that was 
all. It did not lead him to consider his weaknesses as a creature affected 
by temperature. Nor did he think about manâ€™s general weakness, able 
to live only within narrow limits of heat and cold."
