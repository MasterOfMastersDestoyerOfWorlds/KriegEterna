In the Arthurian Poem <i>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</i> a knight clad all in green comes to Camelot in order to play a Christmas game. He explains the game like this: the Green Knight will give to the knight that strikes him his giant axe as long as he can strike the knight back in the same manner in one year's time. Sir Gawayne, the youngest in the court, offers to play and cuts the Green Knight's head clean off. The Green Knight, a magical being, picks up his own decapitated head and tells Gawayne to meet him at the Green Chapel in one year.  The rest of the poem describes Gawayne's journey to the Green Chapel and his cowardice surrounding his looming doom.
