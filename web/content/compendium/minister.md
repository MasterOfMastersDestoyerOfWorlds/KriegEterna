Gold, soldiers, and a vast newtork of spies: these were the tools that Cardinal Richelieu used to reshape France into the dominant power on the continent. The chief minister under Louis XIII (see also {{<cardlink name="Traitor King" code="traitor-king">}}), Richelieu forged French foriegn and domestic policy for most of the King's reign. Richelieu saw the Spanish and Austrian Hapsburgs as France's main rivals and sought to undermine them by funding their enemies in Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. At first he did so covertly through secret envoys and treaties and eventually overtly by declaring war on both kingdoms. Domestically, Richelieu fought to destroy the powerful French nobels and Protestant Huguenots by systematically destroying their castles and fortifications, making it much harder for them to rebel against the King. In a time when most rulers were concerned with religious and dynastic allegiances, Richelieu drove the French Crown towards an impersonal nationalism that has defined much of the modern era as opposed to the personal relationships that governed earlier eras.
