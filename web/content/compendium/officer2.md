Where lies the soul? The Greeks thought it resided in the heart, and today we think it the brain is the primary organ. But could a brain be said to be human if it could not feel the sun on its skin or hold the ones it loved? We tend to remove ourselves from machines saying they will never replace us, as if there was some magic force within a man to make him unreplaceable! Yet are not mothers replaced by their daughters and fathers sons?

True, machines made by man are crude compared to anything that nature has made, and even the simplest of proteins are marvels compared to our accomplishments. But we haven't been in the nearly game as long as Nature, and still we have made great leaps and bounds in our understanding (see also {{<cardlink name="Omen">}}). As we try to replicate the soul, we made find that our own mechanisms are lacking. A thing that is indecipherable is magic, but the same thing once understood becomes commonplace. The soul will not change, but its observers will. </p>
