"Dynamite will sooner lead to peace than a thousand world conventions." is Alfred Nobel’s most famous quote.  When Nobel died, he had homes in several countries.  Ultimately it was determined that his home was in Sweden because he had moved his horses to his Swedish estate, leading to the idea that “your home is where your horses are.”  Nobel’s will set up the famous Nobel Prizes, including the Nobel Peace Prize to be awarded to the “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations. . .”
