Three young boys look at the solar system as it is explained by an old philosopher. The flavor text is attributed to Blaise Pascal's essay <i>Of the Geometrical Spirit</i> in which he explains some of his thoughts regarding proofs and definitions and how they relate to the underlying truth of the world. In the essay, Pascal describes how we must make assumptions of the true nature of the world and then build from those assumptions and how many things can only be defined self-referentially. Euclid's Elements is a great example of this because, in his list of assumptions, the "Parallel Postulate" states that lines that aren't parallel must meet if extended forever. This assumption is useful in many geometrical proofs, but in the 19th century geometrical spaces where this is not assumed would be explored creating the field of non-Euclidean geometry. Both sets of geometries describe the world in some conditions and fail to describe it in others. The truth is only true so far as the starting assumptions hold.
