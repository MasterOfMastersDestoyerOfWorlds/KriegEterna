<p>
<i>Crime and Punishment</i> revolves around a murder and the psychology of a murderer. The subject and narrator of the novel Rodion Raskolnikov believes that he is a great man of history like that of Napoleon or Alexander, and uses this belief to justify the murder and robbery of an elderly woman and her pawn shop. Certainly there are times and places in which society has deemed killing not only moral but honorable, but what society deems right and what corrodes the soul are two different things entirely. Can a man look into another's soul and judge wether that person should live or die when he cannot understand his own?

“Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends”
