The Weller Brothers were Australian merchants that ran the whale trade in New Zealand during the early 1800's. By the 1830's they captured some 300 whales in a single year, owned seven whaling stations, and at their peak exported 310 tons of whale oil per year. But just as quickly as the Wellermen made their fortunes, they were nearly bankrupt by 1840 due to a decline in the whale population and a scheme to buy up large parts of New Zealand before it was recognized as a crown colony that ultimately failed.
