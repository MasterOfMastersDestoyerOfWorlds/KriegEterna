<p class="rule-paragraph">
Painted by the great Italian painter Caravaggio, the painting depicts the moment when Christ, having been interrogated by Pontius Pilate, is crowned with thorns and derided as the “King of the Jews.”  Caravaggio’s distinctive painting style is shown here, with the use of foreshortening, the extreme light source and incision to outline the contours of the painting.

<p class="rule-paragraph">
The flavor text is from Luke 23:40, King James Bible.  Words of the second thief crucified with Christ.
