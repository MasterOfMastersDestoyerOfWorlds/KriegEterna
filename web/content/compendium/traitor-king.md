<p>
Louis XIII was the French Monarch most closely involved in the Thirty Years War and French Wars of Religion.  Although an ardent Catholic, Louis and his minister Cardinal Richelieu (see also {{<cardlink name="Minister" code="minister">}}) allied themselves with the Protestant Germans, the Swedish (see also {{<cardlink name="Lion King" code="lion-king">}}), and the Dutch against the Hapsburg forces in Spain and Austria. They sent large quantities of subsidies and soldiers to fund their Protestant allies abroad while waging war against the Huguenot Protestants at home.

<p>
This clearly conflicted against Louis' and many Catholics' sense of just action, but Richelieu (who may be as close to Machevelli's <i>The Prince</i> as any early modern ruler) convinced the King that the good of France did not align with the good of Catholicism as a whole. Louis' consolidation of French power and weakening of the empire allowed his son Louis XIV (see also {{<cardlink name="Sun King" code="sun-king">}}) to become the most powerful and absolutist French monarch until the time of Napoleon.
