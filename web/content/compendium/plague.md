{{<card-detail-page title="Plague" artwork="Human Fragility by Salvator Rosa (17th century)">}}
<p class="rule-paragraph">
After one of the most deadly plauges in history, Salvator Rosa painted this card art in Naples. During the plague, he lost many of his family members including his brother, sister, and son. The death toll would reach 1.25 million across southern Italy and in some cities the population was a half or a third compared to pre-plague totals. The flavor text for this card comes from another plague three centuries earlier in Siena. The full quotation is as follows: 
</p>
<p class="rule-paragraph">
“And I, Agnolo di Tura called Grasso, buried five of my sons in one trench with my own hands; and many others did the like. And also there were some that were so badly covered up that the dogs dragged them out, and ate many bodies in the city. No bells tolled, and no one wept at any misfortune that befel, for almost every person expected death; and the thing went in such wise that folk thought that no one would remain on live, and many men believed and said: This is the end of the world. Here no physician availed, nor medicine, nor any defence; rather it seemed that the more precaution a man took, the sooner he died.”
