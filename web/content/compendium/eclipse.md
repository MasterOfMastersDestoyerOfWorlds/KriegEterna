<p class="rule-paragraph">
Eclipses have often been seen as ill omens or linked to the divine (see also {{<cardlink name="Omen" code="omen">}}). In the final battle between the Medes and the Lydians in Ancient Anatolia: "just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night...when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on."

<p class="rule-paragraph">
Eclipses were also used to explain the outbreaks of various plagues (see also {{<cardlink name="Plague" code="plague">}}), crop failures and, in the case of the Aztec's, the Spanish conquest of Mexico. One witness to the 1508 eclipse said: "Piece by piece, the fire of the sun was eaten until it was replaced by a ring of fire. There was no way to see it and not foretell the total destruction of the world."
