<p>
Eclipses have often been seen as ill omens or linked to the divine (see also {{<cardlink name="Omen" code="omen">}} or {{<cardlink name="Ruin">}}). In the final battle between the Medes and the Lydians in Ancient Anatolia: "just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night...when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on."

Eclipses were also used to explain the outbreaks of various plagues (see also {{<cardlink name="Plague" code="plague">}}), crop failures and, in the case of the Aztecs, the Spanish conquest of Mexico. One witness to the 1508 eclipse in central America said: "Piece by piece, the fire of the sun was eaten until it was replaced by a ring of fire. There was no way to see it and not foretell the total destruction of the world."
