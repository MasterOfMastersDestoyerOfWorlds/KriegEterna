Unit’s cry of “Now, my boys, Scotland forever!” as they charged at the Battle of Waterloo.  Considered a turning point of the battle, the cavalry charged the French despite an order from Wellington to remain in place until he gave order.  They likely saved the British line, but in the process sustained significant casualties to both men and horses. A later French cavalry charge led by marshal Ney would end in disaster, as the English responded by forming {{<cardlink name="squares" code="square">}} making it impossible for the cavalry to do much damage.

Copies of the painting, one of a few military paintings by a woman painter, were given to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.  During World War I the Germans used the image for propaganda purposes, turning the soldiers into Prussians.
