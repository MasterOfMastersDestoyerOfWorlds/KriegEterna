{{<card-detail-image file="leonardo.jpg" caption="Leonardo Da Vinci's Gun">}}
To sate the lust of power; more horrid still,
<br>
The foulest stain and scandal of our nature
<br>
Became its boast. — One Murder made a Villain,
<br>
Millions a Hero. — Princes were privileg'd
<br>
To kill, and numbers sanctified the crime.
<br>
Ah! why will Kings forget that they are Men?
<br>
And Men that they are brethren? Why delight
<br>
In human sacrifice? Why burst the ties
<br>
Of Nature, that should knit their souls together
<br>
In one soft bond of amity and love?
<br>
Yet still they breathe destruction, still go on
<br>
Inhumanly ingenious to find out
<br>
New pains for life, new terrors for the grave,
<br>
Artificers of Death! Still Monarchs dream
<br>
Of universal Empire growing up
<br>
From universal ruin. — Blast the design,
<br>
Great God of Hosts, nor let thy creatures fall
<br>
Unpitied victims at Ambition's shrine!
