The year is 1815, Napoleon is about to escape his island prison and declare the Second French Empire (see also {{<cardlink name="Grenadier" code="grenadier">}}), and Edmond Dantes lies rotting in the dungeon of the Château d'If off the coast of southern France. Dantes was sent here as a suspected Bonapartist and will serve six years before making his escape.

He is aided in his escape by a priest, Abbe Faria who has been digging a tunnel that mistakenly end in Dantes' room. The priest being sickly and knowing he is about to die tells Dantes of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo off of the coast of Italy. Interestingly enough, Monte Cristo acted as a refuge for some early Christian hermits who attempted to escape the Vandals after Western Rome fell. Pope Gregory then founded a monastery on the island and the monastic donations sent there gave the island a reputation for hidden treasure (see also {{<cardlink name="Crusade" code="crusade">}}).

When Father Faria dies, Dantes seizes the opportunity and impersonates his corpse being cast into the sea and finally making his escape. The rest of Alexandre Dumas' wonderful novel follows Dantes in his quest for revenge against those who have wronged him and sent him to prison. Armed with a pile of gold and an iron will, is there anything the Count of Monte Cristo won't do to exact his revenge?
