"The city which had taken the whole world was itself taken" (see also {{<cardlink name="Catapult" code="catapult">}}). The Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 was the sign of a dying western roman empire. Rome which had not been sacked in 800 years, was sieged three times by the Visigoth King, Alric, in the early 400s. For three days the Visigoths took whatever valuables they could find, tortured the defenders, and desecrated the tombs of the Roman Emperors (see also {{<cardlink name="Assassin">}}). Only the churches were left relatively untouched. Rome itself, the city that at one point was the most populous in the world, would be reduced to a population of 30,000 by 537 after repeated Gothic invasions and large parts of the old city would be relatively abandoned (see also {{<cardlink name="Crusade" code="crusade">}}).
