The battle of Friedland, near Pravdinsk, Russia, was a decisive victory for the Napoleonic French army over the Tsarist Russian army.  Initially a Russian attack on a smaller French unit of reserves, the Russian forces were forced to flee across the Alle river when Napoleon reinforced his men with 80,000 troops.  The Russians lost over 40% of their forces, and the defeat ultimately led to the Treaty of Tilsit, the creation of the Kingdom of Westphalia and the height of Napoleon’s empire (see also  {{<cardlink name="Feint">}}).

Edouard Detaille was a famous French military painter who is quoted as saying he sought to render the effect of a cavalry charge of men “who were going to their deaths covered in gold embroidery.”

The flavor text is a reference to the seven trumpets of the book of Revelations that will be blown by angels of God, leading to the destruction of this world and the beginning of the Kingdom of the Christian God.
