The flavor text is in reference to the "Shot heard 'round the world". This phrase was first used to describe the battle at Lexington and Concord that marked the first action of the revolutionary war (see also {{<cardlink name="Officer" code="officer3">}}). Later it was used to describe the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which set off World War One. After dodging an earlier assassination attempt during the morning, the Archdukes car route changed to unknowingly stop in front of one of the failed assassins, Gavrilo Princip. As with all things, the narrative that the Serbian terrorists, or the reaction of Austria and Germany to the assassination, caused the war is likely too simple.

The card art depicts Chouan anti-revolutionaries, who fought against the First French Republic in a protracted guerilla campaign. Their main aims were not necessarily to return the monarchy to power, but to fight against forced conscription and the curtailment of Church privileges which had been under attack by the atheist revolutionary government.
