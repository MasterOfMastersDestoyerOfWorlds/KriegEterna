<p>
This painting, by the French painter Francois Flameng, shows Marie Antoinette on her way to the guillotine October 16, 1793.  She was the last queen of France before the French Revolution and the wife of King Louis XVI, who had been executed on January 21, 1793 after the monarch had been abolished.  Born into the Hapsburg dynasty of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I, she was married to Louis in 1770 at age 14 as a means to end hostilities between France and Austria.  Her lavish spending and resistance to social reforms made her unpopular with the French, and she was accused of sympathizing with the Austrian empire.
