It is often underestimated how important things like dry socks and hot food are for the success of an army. Some of the best Generals in American history, including Sherman, Patton, and Ridgway, have understood this well. A good leader cannot lead from a continent or even a mile away, they must constantly be seen by their men and remind them of the basics, cause when the rain comes it is better to be prepared by tedious repetition than by the enemy. This is not however, the common outlook of many less than successful leaders who rather rely on numerical and supply advantage than sound leadership. If this is an outlook you share, I recommend reading <i>The Savior Generals</i> by Victor Davis Hanson or listening to his talks on the book.

In many ways Allied leaders on the western front of World War I took the opposite view, they were often miles behind the front line, they did not bother much with the hygienic health of their soldiers, and their was a real separation between the leadership and their men. This often ended tragically in many ways with unnecessary loss of life and high rates of disease deaths.

For a more complete view of the muddy and blood soaked trenches read <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> by Erich Maria Remarque, the novel is excellent as well as the recent film adaptation on Netflix.

Another interesting World War I film <i>Paths of Glory</i> directed by Stanley Kubrick contains many of the same themes and relies less on gorey images.
