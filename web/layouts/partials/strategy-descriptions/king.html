All King cards allow you to double a row of your choosing, essentially functioning as a trump card for the round. Your
opponent will likely need to play their King card or some other counter to remain competitive in that round. Remember,
Kings also come with the choice of a unique effect (in addition to doubling a row), allowing you to tailor your strategy
as the game unfolds.
