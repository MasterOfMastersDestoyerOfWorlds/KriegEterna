{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} is effectively a one-turn stall card. Although you get to draw
more cards than your opponent, it works out that all players will net one extra card, relative to before {{partial
"carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} was played. However, it is now your opponentâ€™s turn, so you not only
replenished cards but also stalled. {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} is a great card to play
when throwing a round.
