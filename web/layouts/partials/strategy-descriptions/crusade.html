{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} works as a counter for adjacency. If your opponent has many adjacent pairs in the same row, it’s likely
that they are also the strongest cards, in which case {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} would destroy them all. You will need to plan
carefully, such that you don’t destroy too many of your own strongest cards.
