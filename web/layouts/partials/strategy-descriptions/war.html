{{partial "carddeadlink.html"  . }} is another variant of {{partial "cardlink.html" (dict "name"
"Death")}}, with the subtlety that all players can choose which cards they send to the graveyard. A good strategy is to
flood your side of the field with weaker or undesired unit cards, then play {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name"
.Params.title)}} to force your opponent to destroy their stronger units.
