{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} is a great tool for card draw, and is useful to redraw unwanted
parts of your hand. Remember that {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} uses total strength to
determine how many cards are drawn; therefore, you can send a doubled or adjacent unit to the graveyard to more easily
achieve the draw-two condition.
