{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} sets up a loan in which you set aside units now (thereby
losing turns and giving up information) in exchange for card draw later. Keep in mind that you will likely lose the
round in which {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} is played, unless youâ€™re able to play it after
your opponent has passed.
