{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} can be used to bluff by playing your King, then returning it
to your hand. An added benefit is that you can use your King’s unique powers twice (once each time your King is played).
Remember, the card is worded so that you can’t reobtain your King if it is already in the graveyard.
