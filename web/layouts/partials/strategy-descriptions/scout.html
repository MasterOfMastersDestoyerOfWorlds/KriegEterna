{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} is a support unit primarily used to create adjacency. Remember
that it can modify up to two units, but doesnâ€™t have to (none, one, or both are all valid choices). Also, you can change
which units are modified at any time; it may be helpful to have the {{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name"
.Page.Title)}} card partially overlapping with the other cards it is currently modifying.
