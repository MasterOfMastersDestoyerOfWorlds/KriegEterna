{{partial "carddeadlink.html" (dict "name" .Page.Title)}} can either be used to (1) disrupt your opponent’s King to help you win the current round, (2) bluff with
your own King, only to utilize it in the next round, or (3) counter an opponent’s bluff if you’ve overcommitted
resources this round (by saving your King for next round). Remember that when the set aside King returns to the field, its
unique power is not repeated, but it still doubles the row it was originally played in.
